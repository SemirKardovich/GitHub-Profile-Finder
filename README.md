# GitHub-Profile-Finder

## ðŸ’¡ Idea

This project offers users to get information on a specific GitHub user such as :

* Number of publick repos
* Followers
* Following
* Gists

As well as their website/blog, location, and their last 5 repos.
Because this application is hosted by GitHub pages, there is a restriction of possible API requests to 60 per hour. 
I could not get around this problem because it requires the client secret code which is not safe for me to upload here since it's a public repo.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and tools

* HTML
* Bootswatch theme
* Java Script ( OOP )
* GitHub API
* Visual Studio Code
